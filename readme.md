Please check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/terjeio/Grbl-GCode-Sender/wiki) for further details.

8-bit Arduino controllers needs _Toggle DTR_ selected in order to reset the controller on connect. Behaviour may be erratic if not set.

Latest release is 2.0.43, see the [changelog](changelog.md) for details.

A complete rewrite of my [Grbl CNC Controls library](https://github.com/terjeio/Grbl_CNC_Controls) including a sender application on top of these. It supports new features in [grblHAL](https://github.com/grblHAL) such as manual tool change and [external MPG](https://github.com/terjeio/GRBL_MPG_DRO_BoosterPack) control - and is one of the reasons for writing this library and app. Other senders I have tried does not play nice when a MPG pendant is connected directly to the Grbl processor card...
